## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### **Data Privacy**

- ✅ All ideas stored locally in your browser
- ✅ No data sent to external servers (except OpenAI for processing)
- ✅ API keys stored securely in local storage
- ✅ No tracking or analytics

### **API Usage**

- Your OpenAI API key is stored locally and never shared
- Only your idea text is sent to OpenAI for processing
- Costs typically $0.001-0.01 per idea (very affordable)
- Rate limiting and error handling built-in

## 🛠️ Customization

### **Adding New AI Providers**

The app is designed to support multiple AI providers. To add support for other services:

1. **Extend API Manager** (`js/api.js`)
1. **Add provider configuration**
1. **Implement provider-specific methods**

### **Styling Customization**

Modify CSS custom properties in `css/styles.css`:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #667eea;     /* Change primary color */
    --success-color: #28a745;     /* Change success color */
    --font-family: 'Your Font';   /* Change font */
}
```

### **Feature Extensions**

- Add new export formats (PDF, Word, etc.)
- Integrate with project management tools
- Add collaboration features
- Implement idea templates

## 📊 Cost Estimation

Typical costs using OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo:

- **Short idea** (50 words): ~$0.001
- **Medium idea** (200 words): ~$0.003
- **Long idea** (500 words): ~$0.007

The app includes built-in cost estimation and will warn you for expensive requests.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**❌ “API key appears invalid”**

- Ensure your API key starts with `sk-`
- Check you have credits available in your OpenAI account
- Try generating a new API key

**❌ “Request failed” errors**

- Check your internet connection
- Verify OpenAI service status
- Try again in a few moments (might be rate limiting)

**❌ Ideas not saving**

- Check browser local storage isn’t full
- Try exporting and importing your data
- Clear browser cache and reload

**❌ Voice input not working**

- Ensure you’re using HTTPS (required for microphone access)
- Check browser microphone permissions
- Try a different browser (Chrome recommended)

### **Performance Tips**

- Export/backup your ideas regularly
- Clear old ideas you no longer need
- Use shorter, more focused idea descriptions for faster processing
